Version 0.5
 * Added icon for notification popups (patch by evgeni@golov.de via Gitorious, 
   thanks!).

Version 0.4
 * Debian packaging.
 * Improved logging and notifications contributed by Dieter Plaetinck.
 * Added improvements by Ren√© 'Necoro' Neumann to make the embedded Jabberbot

   until the connection can be re-established.

   none).

Version 0.3
 * First public release, announced on vcs-home@lists.madduck.net.
