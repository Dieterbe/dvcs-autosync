Version 0.4
 * Significantly improved event coalescing to distinguish between events on 
   a single file (being updated repeatedly e.g. by an editor) and events on
   multiple files (such as moving directories or unpacking archives).
 * Debian packaging.
 * Improved logging and notifications contributed by Dieter Plaetinck.
 * Added improvements by Ren√© 'Necoro' Neumann to make the embedded Jabberbot
   more stable with regards to reconnections. Instead of running a tight loop
   while trying to reconnect, ping the server regularly and queue the messages
   until the connection can be re-established.

Version 0.3
 * First public release, announced on vcs-home@lists.madduck.net.
